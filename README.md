[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubyforgood/partner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubyforgood/partner)

This is the companion application to the [diaper](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper) app. The diaper app is an
inventory management system and this partner application handles the onboarding, approving, and handling of requests
from diaper banks from their partners. Diaper banks do not distribute diapers directly to the public. They
distribute diapers to partners like women's shelters, food pantries, homeless shelters, and other organizations.

The flow for partners being created, approved, and finally approved works as follows:

1) A diaper bank enters a new partner into the the diaper application.
    * The diaper app sends a post request to the partner app containing `organization_id`, `partner_id`, and 
    `email`. The organization id is the diaper bank id and the partner id is the partner id are the corresponding
    ids in the diaper app.
2) On receiving this post request, the partner app immediately sends an email to the new partner inviting them
to become a user.
3) The new potential partner fills out the details on about their organization, uploads required documentations
and then submits for approval.
    * A post request is sent to the diaper app updating the status of the partner to ready for review.
4) The diaper bank reviews and approves the partner.
    * A get request is made to the partner app to grab the relevant partner information for review.
    * After review, a post request is made to the partner app changing their status to approved.
5) The approved partner can now fill out requests for diapers to their diaper bank partner.
    * After a request is made, a post request is made to the diaper app containing the requested diapers.
6) The diaper bank sees the request, approves it, and creates a distribution. Once the distribution is created,
the partner gets an email notification stating their pick up date and a pdf copy of their invoice.

## Development

There are detailed instructions for installation on Ubuntu hosts in the [ubuntu-installation.md](ubuntu-installation.md) file. As of now, there are no detailed instructions for Mac installation, but if you have any problems, the Ubuntu file may shed some light on them.


### Ruby Version

This app uses Ruby version 2.6.2, indicated in `/.ruby-version` and `Gemfile`, which will be auto-selected if you use a Ruby versioning manager like `rvm` or `rbenv`.


### Database Configuration

This app uses PostgreSQL for all environments. You'll also need to create the `dev` and `test` databases, the app is expecting them to be named `partner_dev` and `partner_test`, respectively. This should all be handled with `bundle exec rails db:setup`.


### Create your .env with database credentials

Be sure to create a `.env` file in the root of the app that includes the following lines (change to whatever is appropriate for your system):
```
PG_USERNAME=username
PG_PASSWORD=password
```
If you're getting the error `PG::ConnectionBad: fe_sendauth: no password supplied`, it's because you have probably not done this.

Optionally, you may add the following line to your `.env`
file, which allows for specifying a database host other
than the default of `localhost`:
```
PG_HOST=hostname
```


## Seed the database

From the root of the app, run `bundle exec rails db:seed`. This will create some initial data to use while testing the app and developing new features, including setting up the default user.


## Logging In

To login, use these default credentials provided in the seeds:

    Verified Organization
      Email: verified@example.com
      Password: password

    Pending Organization
      Email: unverified@example.com
      Password: password
